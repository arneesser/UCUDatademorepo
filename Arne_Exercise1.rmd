Research Question: Do movies from the 2000s with a higher budget also have a higher revenue?

Variables:
* Movie Title
* Date
* Year
* Budget
* Revenue

Geometric shape required: 
* Scatterplot Graph
```{r}
#Load Data
library(tidyverse)
movies <- read_csv('movies.csv')
```
Here I filter only the movies from the 2000s with budget and revenue > 0.  
```{r}
movies_2000s <- movies %>%
  filter(decade=='2000s') %>%
  filter(budget > 0) %>%
  filter(revenue > 0)
```
Here I plot the relationship between budget vs. revenue for movies produced in the 2000s.
```{r}
ggplot(data = movies_2000s) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = budget, y = revenue,)) +
  xlab("budget ($)")+
  ylab("revenue ($)") +
ggtitle("Revenue vs Budget for 2000s Movies")
```
A general trend that we see is that movies produced generate a revnenue that is similarly around their budget expenditure.
